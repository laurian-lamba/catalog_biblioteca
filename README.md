## Thanks for Purchasing LMS system
## About LMS System 

LMS system is build keeping in mind the problems faced in running a library.
It has all the major feature which are importants. If there any important modules,
you think that is not in the system you can drop us a mail and we would go through it.
And push and update for all our users.


## Installation Procedure

- First upload the zip file to the server and extract it over there.
- Then after that you have to edit the .env file and add the required details like the db
credentials and other things.
- Then Open you url eg: http://domain.com/install-db , on the first run the system will install the db tables to the db
if you like to manually do this procedure then the db file is located at
storage/dummy.sql
** [Note for technical people]: ** After the first run is done and the db tables are installed the system creates a file called 
"installed" in folder storage/ if you like to reset the db to the default state
then you will have to remove that file for system to reset your db to the default state.

## School Management System
We have an other product as well called sms system.
 which you can find at [Ricomart](http://ricomart.com). Give it a shot as well.

## License

This is a single license code. It means you can use this for single domain only. If you like to install it on multiple domain then you would have to purchase an other license.
Make sure you use an different email id to purchase an other license. 
The purchase code is nothing but your invoice no. 
These license code is basically used to get updates from our server.
After you license gets expired the system will still work only the 
updates will not work.
